This late bedtime can disrupt your circadian rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. A bedtime between 10:00-11:00 PM and wake time between 8:00-9:00 AM would be more ideal.\n\n### Sleep Quality\n\nYour deep sleep percentage (70%) is very high, which is generally a positive sign. However, your REM sleep percentage (18%) is low. Typically, most adults should have 15-25% REM sleep. Your light sleep percentage (12%) is also relatively low. This suggests that you may be spending too much time in lighter stages of sleep.\n\n### Alertness\n\nThere are no data points to analyze for alertness.\n\n### Timing\n\nYour bedtime (00:45) and wake time (07:00) are very late. A bedtime between 10:00-11:00 PM and wake time between 8:00-9:00 AM would be more ideal.\n\n### Efficiency\n\nYour sleep efficiency (88%) is excellent. This means you spend a high proportion of your time in bed actually asleep.\n\n### Duration\n\nYour sleep duration (6.2 hours) is within the recommended range for adults (7-9 hours).\n\n### Other\n\nGiven your late bedtime and high deep sleep percentage, it's likely that you're spending too much time in bed. This could be impacting your productivity and daily functioning. Reducing your bedtime and increasing your wake time could help improve your sleep quality and overall well-being. It's also important to consider the potential effects of your smoking status on your sleep. If you're not currently smoking, it's worth discussing the potential risks of smoking with your doctor.<|eot_id|>\nType: A1 | ID: 2\n\n## Sleep Insights Report\n\nHere's an analysis of your sleep data:\n\n**Routine**\n\n*   **Bedtime:** 11:30 PM, **Wake-up time:** 6:30 AM, **Midsleep point:** 1:30 AM. Your bedtime is later than average and your wake-up time is earlier than average. This discrepancy may affect your ability to maintain a consistent sleep schedule.\n\n**Sleep Quality**\n\n*   **REM Sleep:** 22%, **Deep Sleep:** 55%, **Light Sleep:** 23%. Your deep sleep percentage is significantly higher than the typical range (13-25%), and your light sleep percentage is lower than the typical range (50-60%). This is unusual and may indicate an imbalance in sleep stages.\n\n**Alertness**\n\n*   **No naps reported**. Your sleep data does not indicate any daytime sleepiness.\n\n**Timing**\n\n*   **Bedtime:** 11:30 PM, **Wake-up time:** 6:30 AM. Your bedtime is later than average and your wake-up time is earlier than average. This discrepancy may affect your ability to maintain a consistent sleep schedule.\n\n**Efficiency**\n\n*   **Sleep Efficiency:** 93%, **Caffeine Consumption:** 2.0, **Alcohol Consumption:** 1.0. Your sleep efficiency is excellent, indicating that you spend a high percentage of time in bed actually asleep.\n\n**Duration**\n\n*   **Sleep Duration:** 7.0 hours, **Average Sleep Duration:** 7.5 hours. Your sleep duration is slightly below the recommended range for adults (7-9 hours). This may be a contributing factor to your sleep quality and efficiency.\n\n**Other**\n\n*   **Smoking:** **No smoking**. Your smoking status is important to consider when evaluating your sleep.\n*   **Exercise Frequency:** **4 times per week**. Regular exercise is beneficial for sleep quality. More exercise could improve sleep efficiency.\n*   **Caffeine Consumption:** **2.0 cups**. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, so reducing or avoiding it may improve sleep quality.\n*   **Alcohol Consumption:** **1.0 drink**. Alcohol can disrupt sleep, so reducing or avoiding it may improve sleep quality.<|eot_id|>\nType: A1 | ID: 3\n\n# Sleep Insights Report\n\n**Routine**\n\n*   A single night of data suggests a consistent sleep schedule. This is excellent for maintaining a stable circadian rhythm.\n\n**Sleep Quality**\n\n*   **Deep Sleep Percentage (65%):** This is significantly above the typical range (13-25%), which is unusual. Deep sleep is a crucial component of restorative sleep.\n*   **Light Sleep Percentage (20%):** This is very low (0-30%), which is typically not present.\n*   **REM Sleep Percentage (15%):** This is within the normal range (20-25%), which is good.\n*   **Awakenings (2):** This is within the normal range (0-5).\n*   **Sleep Efficiency (85%):** This is below the typical range (85-95%), which is concerning. This indicates a significant amount of time spent awake in bed after falling asleep.\n\n**Alertness**\n\n*   **No naps reported:** This is excellent for maintaining daytime alertness.\n\n**Timing**\n\n*   **Bedtime (10:15 PM) and Wakeup (6:00 AM) are reasonable, but the midsleep point is 1.5 AM, which is later than optimal.** This is likely due to the low light sleep percentage.\n\n**Efficiency**\n\n*   **Sleep Efficiency (85%) is below the optimal range (85-95%).** This is a significant concern, indicating a substantial amount of time spent awake in bed.\n\n**Duration**\n\n*   **7.75 hours of sleep is within the recommended range (7-9 hours) for a 72-year-old.** This is a good amount of sleep, but the high awakenings and low sleep efficiency are areas for improvement.\n\n**Other**\n\n*   **Smoking is a significant risk factor for sleep disorders, including sleep fragmentation and daytime fatigue.** Quitting smoking is essential for improving sleep quality.\n*   **Caffeine consumption is low (0.0), which is beneficial for sleep.** Avoiding caffeine is recommended.\n*   **Exercise frequency (2 times per week) is good for overall health, but increasing this to 3-4 times per week could improve sleep efficiency and overall health.** More frequent exercise could also improve sleep quality.\n*   **The low light sleep percentage (20%) is unusual and may indicate a sleep disorder.** This should be investigated further.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1.  **Deep Sleep (65%) is significantly above the normal range (13-25%).** This is unusual and should be investigated further.\n2.  **Light Sleep (20%) is very low (0-30%) and not within the normal range.** This is not typical and may indicate a sleep disorder.\n3.  **Sleep Efficiency (85%) is below the optimal range (85-95%).** This is a significant concern and warrants further investigation.\n4.  **Awakenings (2) are within the normal range (0-5).** This is good.\n5.  **Sleep Duration (7.75 hours) is within the recommended range (7-9 hours).** This is good.\n6.  **Exercise Frequency (2 times per week) is good for overall health, but increasing this to 3-4 times per week could improve sleep efficiency and overall health.** More exercise could also improve sleep quality.\n7.  **Smoking\nType: A1 | ID: 4\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### Routine\n- **Routine:** The bedtime (12:30 AM) and wake-up time (8:00 AM) are inconsistent. The bedtime is late and the wake-up time is early. This inconsistency can disrupt the body's natural circadian rhythm.\n\n### Sleep Quality\n- **REM Sleep:** The REM sleep percentage is 20%, which is within the normal range.\n- **Deep Sleep:** The deep sleep percentage is 50%, which is significantly higher than the typical range. This could indicate a misalignment of sleep stages.\n- **Light Sleep:** The light sleep percentage is 30%, which is within the normal range.\n- **Awakenings:** There is one awakening, which is within the normal range.\n\n### Alertness\n- **No Naps:** There are no naps, which is good for maintaining alertness and preventing daytime sleepiness.\n\n### Timing\n- **Bedtime:** 12:30 AM is late, especially for someone in their 50s.\n- **Wakeup Time:** 8:00 AM is early, especially considering the late bedtime.\n- **Sleep Duration:** 7.5 hours is slightly below the recommended 7-9 hours for adults.\n\n### Efficiency\n- **Sleep Efficiency:** 90%, which is within the recommended range (85-95%).\n- **Awakenings:** 1.5 awakenings is within the normal range.\n- **Sleep Duration:** 7.5 hours is slightly below the recommended 7-9 hours.\n\n### Duration\n- **Sleep Duration:** 7.5 hours is slightly below the recommended 7-9 hours.\n- **Consistency:** The inconsistent bedtime and wake-up time can affect the consistency of sleep.\n- **Efficiency:** 90% sleep efficiency is within the recommended range (85-95%). However, the low number of awakenings may suggest some sleep fragmentation.\n- **Duration:** 7.5 hours is below the recommended 7-9 hours, which can impact overall sleep quality and daytime alertness.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A1 | ID: 5\n\n# Sleep Insights Report\n\n**Routine:**\n\n*   **Bedtime (2021-07-04 23:00:00) and Wake-up time (2021-07-05 06:00:00) indicate a consistent sleep schedule.** This is excellent, as it suggests a reliable bedtime and wake-up time, which is crucial for maintaining healthy sleep patterns.\n\n**Sleep Quality:**\n\n*   **Deep sleep (60%) is significantly higher than the typical range (13-25%), and REM sleep (25%) is within the normal range.** This is unusual and warrants further investigation. A high percentage of deep sleep is often associated with aging, but the extremely high rate (60%) suggests an unusual sleep profile.\n*   **Light sleep (15%) is low.** This is below the typical range (50-65%) and could indicate a disrupted sleep cycle.\n*   **Awakenings (0.5) are normal, but the consistency of sleep duration is exceptional.** This suggests that the sleeper is staying in bed for a long time after waking up.\n\n**Efficiency:**\n\n*   **Sleep efficiency (95%) is excellent, indicating minimal time spent awake in bed.** This is excellent, suggesting the sleeper is very restful and comfortable in bed.\n*   **No naps are reported, which is beneficial for overall sleep health.**\n\n**Duration:**\n\n*   **7.0 hours of sleep is within the recommended range (7-9 hours for adults).** This is good, indicating that the sleeper is getting enough sleep.\n*   **The high percentage of deep sleep (60%) is unusual and warrants further investigation.** This could be a sign of an underlying sleep disorder.\n\n**Timing:**\n\n*   **Bedtime (2021-07-04 23:00:00) and wake-up time (2021-07-05 06:00:00) suggest a consistent sleep schedule.** This is excellent, as it suggests that the sleeper is maintaining a regular sleep-wake cycle.\n*   **No data on midsleep point or average bedtime wake-up time is not available.** This information is important for understanding sleep patterns and making recommendations for improving sleep quality.\n*   **Caffeine consumption (0.5 cups) is low.** This is positive, as caffeine can disrupt sleep if consumed too close to bedtime.\n*   **No data on alcohol consumption is available.** This information is important for understanding potential sleep disruptions.\n\n**Other:**\n\n*   **Exercise frequency (5.0 times per week) is good for overall health, but may not be directly related to sleep.** While regular physical activity is beneficial, it's not directly linked to sleep.\n*   **Smoking status (no data) is important for overall health, as smoking can affect sleep.** While smoking is not directly related to sleep, it's still important to consider the potential impact on sleep quality.\n*   **No data on daytime alertness or circadian rhythm is available.** This information is important for understanding how the sleeper is feeling during the day and how sleep patterns might impact it.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 1\n\nOkay, let's break down the potential causes of your sleep patterns, ordered from most to least relevant.\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Very Likely):** Your high caffeine intake (75mg) is a strong extrinsic factor that likely plays a significant role in your sleep difficulties. Even though you're getting 8 hours of sleep, caffeine can disrupt sleep architecture, leading to awakenings. This is a very likely cause, as the data shows a high caffeine intake and you're experiencing awakenings.\n\n**2. Circadian Rhythm (Possible):** Your bedtime (10:00 PM) and wake-up time (6:00 AM) suggest a midsleep point that is slightly later than average. This could be a result of your natural sleep cycle, but it's not a definitive cause, as other factors could also be influencing your sleep.\n\n**3. Homeostatic Drive (Possible):** Your sleep duration (8 hours) is within a healthy range, but the high caffeine intake (75mg) is likely affecting your sleep architecture, leading to awakenings. This is a possible cause, as caffeine can decrease sleep efficiency and increase awakenings.\n\n**4. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Unlikely):** While you're experiencing two awakenings, this is not strong evidence for hyperarousal. The data suggests that awakenings are more related to caffeine intake than a lack of sleep.\n\n**5. Smoking (Unlikely):** Your smoking status (no) is unlikely to be a factor in your sleep difficulties. Even if smoking affects your sleep, it would likely be more related to other factors rather than a primary cause.\n\n**6. Exercise Frequency (Unlikely):** Your exercise frequency (2 times a week) is low and unlikely to be a significant factor in your sleep difficulties. Even if exercise is important for overall health, it would likely not be a major contributor to your sleep issues.<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 2\n\nHere's an analysis of the potential underlying causes, focusing on the most likely explanations:\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Very Likely):**\n*   **Caffeine Consumption:** A significant amount of 100mg of caffeine (1 cup of coffee) is likely disrupting sleep architecture. This is a well-documented sleep disruptor. The timing (late evening) and amount (100mg) are particularly concerning, as they can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n**2. Homeostatic Drive (Possible):**\n*   **Sleep Duration:** An 8-hour sleep duration is within the recommended range (7-9 hours for adults). However, the low sleep efficiency (82%) and frequent awakenings (3) suggest that homeostatic sleep drive is not the primary factor here. Homeostatic sleep drive is the natural tendency for the body to sleep a certain amount of time. The low sleep efficiency suggests that this drive is not strong enough.\n\n**3. Circadian Rhythm (Possible):**\n*   **Bedtime (9:45 PM) vs. Wake-up time (5:45 AM):** While the timing is important, the circadian rhythm is also a significant factor. If the body's natural sleep-wake cycle is not aligned, it could explain the fragmented sleep, awakenings, and low sleep efficiency. The earlier bedtime might not be the most effective for everyone.\n\n**4. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Unlikely):**\n*   **Caffeine Consumption:** This is the most unlikely cause, given that caffeine is known to disrupt sleep architecture, especially in higher doses.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 3\n\nOkay, let's break down the potential underlying causes for your sleep patterns:\n\n**1. Circadian Rhythm (Very Likely):** Your consistent bedtime and wake-up time, combined with a moderate smoking habit, suggest a strong circadian preference. This aligns with the sleep efficiency of 90% and moderate awakenings. Your circadian rhythm is likely aligned with a natural sleep-wake cycle that aligns with your natural biological clock.\n\n**2. Homeostatic Drive (Possible):** Your sleep duration is 8 hours, which is within the recommended range. However, your sleep efficiency is very high (90%), indicating that you are spending a lot of time in bed and not feeling tired. This suggests that your homeostatic sleep drive is likely sufficient, but other factors could be contributing to this.\n\n**3. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Unlikely):** While you do experience one awakening, your sleep efficiency is very high, which suggests that you are not experiencing excessive restlessness or difficulty falling asleep. This makes hyperarousal less likely.\n\n**4. Extrinsic Factors (Unlikely):** Your caffeine consumption (20mg) and alcohol consumption (5 units) are unlikely to be directly impacting your sleep. The moderate amount of caffeine is unlikely to significantly impact your sleep architecture, and the alcohol is unlikely to be a major contributor to your sleep issues. The smoking habit is a potential extrinsic factor, but it is not directly impacting your sleep.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 4\n\nHere's an analysis of the potential underlying causes of your sleep patterns, ordered from most to least relevant:\n\n1.  **Extrinsic Factors (Very Likely):** The high level of caffeine consumption (30mg) is a significant extrinsic factor. Caffeine can disrupt sleep architecture, especially in combination with other stimulants. This could be contributing to your low sleep efficiency and awakenings. The fact that you exercise regularly suggests that the stimulant effect of caffeine is not the primary cause. However, the timing of caffeine consumption (bedtime vs. wake-up) and the amount of caffeine (30mg) are important. If the timing and amount of caffeine are consistent, it may be more of a behavioral or psychological issue than a physiological one.\n\n2.  **Homeostatic Drive (Likely):** Your sleep duration of 8.5 hours is within the recommended range for adults. The low sleep efficiency (88%) and awakenings (2) suggest that you may have a low homeostatic sleep drive. This means that even when you're tired, you're not getting enough sleep to feel rested. This is a common issue in older adults.\n\n3.  **Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Possible):** The two awakenings suggest that you may be experiencing some level of psychophysiologic hyperarousal. This is a common issue in older adults, where the brain is less able to relax and fall asleep. It's a common response to stress or anxiety, but can be exacerbated by other factors. It's difficult to determine the cause without further data.\n\n4.  **Circadian Rhythm (Unlikely):** Your consistent bedtime and wake-up time suggest a stable circadian rhythm. This is unlikely to be the primary cause of your sleep issues, as the data doesn't strongly suggest a misalignment.\n\n5.  **Smoking (Unlikely):** There is no indication of smoking in your sleep data. While smoking is a known risk factor for sleep disturbances, the absence of this information makes it less likely to be the primary cause of your sleep issues.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 5\n\nHere's an analysis of the potential causes affecting your sleep:\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Very Likely):**\n\n*   **Caffeine:** A 80mg dose is a significant amount of caffeine. Caffeine can disrupt sleep architecture, leading to fragmented sleep, reduced sleep efficiency, and increased awakenings. The high intake of caffeine could be a major factor, especially if you're consuming it close to bedtime.\n\n*   **Smoking:** Smoking is a known sleep disruptor. Nicotine can interfere with sleep onset and maintenance, leading to fragmented sleep, awakenings, and poor sleep efficiency. Smoking can also reduce sleep quality and increase daytime fatigue.\n\n**2. Circadian Rhythm (Possible):**\n\n*   **Delayed Sleep Phase:** Your bedtime of 11 PM and wake-up of 7 AM could be causing you to feel more tired later in the day, which might not be ideal for overall health. However, the timing itself is not necessarily out of sync, but the consistency of this schedule could be contributing to the issues.\n\n**3. Homeostatic Drive (Possible):**\n\n*   **Low Sleep Efficiency:** Your sleep efficiency is 80%, which is lower than the recommended range. This could indicate a reduced homeostatic drive for sleep. If you're not getting enough sleep, your body may not be getting the sleep it needs, leading to lower sleep efficiency.\n\n**4. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Possible):**\n\n*   **High Caffeine:** This could be contributing to your fragmented sleep and increased awakenings. While caffeine is generally a stimulant, it can cause arousal and disrupt sleep, especially when consumed in large amounts or close to bedtime.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   **High caffeine consumption and smoking are the most likely contributing factors**.\n*   **Extrinsic factors (caffeine and smoking) are likely causing your sleep issues**.\n*   **Homeostatic drive (sleep efficiency) is possible, but not as strongly linked**.\n*   **Circadian rhythm (delayed sleep phase) is a possible contributing factor**.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 1\n\nOkay, here's a recommendation based on the data:\n\n**Goal Bedtime:** 12:30 AM  \n**Goal Wake Time:** 7:00 AM  \n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Gradual Shift:** To address the high deep sleep percentage, aim for a gradual shift towards a more balanced sleep schedule. For the next month, try to maintain a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, but gradually increase the bedtime by 15-minute increments every few days until you reach 12:30 AM. This gradual shift will help stabilize deep sleep architecture.  \n\n2.  **Light Exposure:** Expose yourself to natural light for at least 30 minutes before bed. This will help regulate your circadian rhythm. Aim for bright light exposure, ideally in the morning.  \n\n3.  **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. Sticking to a regular bedtime and wake-up time will help regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n4.  **Avoid Stimulating Activities:** Avoid stimulating activities, electronics, and exercise for at least an hour before bedtime. This will help reduce alertness and promote relaxation.\n\n5.  **Monitor Sleep Quality:** For the next month, track your sleep data, including sleep efficiency, light sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep, and awakenings. This will help identify any patterns or inconsistencies in your sleep.\n\n6.  **Caffeine and Alcohol:** Avoid caffeine and alcohol for the next month. If you're sensitive to these substances, consider reducing or eliminating them altogether.\n\n7.  **Exercise:** Continue your regular exercise routine, aiming for at least 4-5 days of exercise per week. This will help improve sleep quality and overall health.\n\n8.  **Sleep Score:** Monitor your sleep score over the next month. A sleep score of 90% or higher is generally considered excellent. If you're consistently scoring below 90%, consider adjusting your sleep habits to improve your sleep score.\n\n9.  **Consistency:** Continue to prioritize consistency, even on weekends. Aim for a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, and avoid napping during the day.\n\n10. **Ask for Help:** If you're struggling to adjust your sleep schedule or experience persistent sleep issues, consider speaking with a healthcare professional. They can provide personalized guidance and support to help you improve your sleep.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you can work towards improving your sleep quality and overall sleep health.<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 2\n\nHere's a recommendation to help you refine your sleep schedule, focusing on one key area that's likely impacting your bedtime consistency:\n\n**Recommendation:** To address the potential issue with fragmented sleep and awakenings, I recommend the following adjustments to your sleep schedule over the next month:\n\n**1.** **Gradual Shift in Sleep Timing:** To improve the consistency of your sleep, I recommend a gradual shift in your sleep timing. Aim to move your bedtime by 15-minute increments every other day until you reach your desired bedtime (e.g., 11:00 PM). This will help your body adjust to a more consistent sleep schedule.\n\n**2.** **Consistent Wake-Up Time:** Prior to bed, aim to stay awake for 30 minutes. This will help your body get into a more stable sleep phase. After waking up, avoid screens for at least an hour.\n\n**3.** **Screen-Free Time Before Bed:** Try to avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) for at least an hour before bedtime. This will help reduce screen time and promote relaxation.\n\n**4.** **Stabilize Your Routine:** Continue to maintain a stable sleep routine, even on weekends. This consistency will help your body adjust to a consistent sleep schedule.\n\n**Key Takeaways:** By gradually shifting your sleep timing, avoiding screens before bed, and reducing screen time, you can improve the consistency of your sleep and reduce awakenings. The key factor affecting your bedtime consistency is likely the inconsistent sleep timing. Make a commitment to this change for the next month and monitor how it affects your sleep quality.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 3\n\nHere's a recommendation to address the sleep stage imbalance, focusing on the most likely contributing factor (Extrinsic Factors):\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n**1. **Gradual Shift to Morning Light Exposure:**** To reduce the likelihood of low light sleep, I recommend increasing your morning light exposure gradually. Aim to start by exposing yourself to bright light (e.g., 10-15 minutes) 30-60 minutes before your desired wake time. This will help signal to your brain that it's time to wake up and reduce the need for sleep.\n\n**2. **Consistent Morning Light Exposure:**** After the gradual light exposure, make it a habit to expose yourself to bright light in the morning. This will help regulate your circadian rhythm and promote a more stable sleep environment.\n\n**3. **Avoid Stimulating Activities Before Bedtime:**** While the current sleep duration is excellent, the low light sleep is a concern. Try to avoid stimulating activities, such as watching TV or scrolling through your phone, for at least an hour before your desired bedtime.\n\n**4. **Monitor Your Sleep Data:**** Track your sleep data for the next month to see if the sleep stage imbalance improves. This will help you identify any patterns or correlations between the data and your sleep architecture.\n\n**5. **Consider a Morning Light Therapy Session:** If the above recommendations don't improve your sleep stage distribution, consider consulting a healthcare professional who specializes in sleep medicine. They can provide guidance on the most effective light exposure schedule and recommend any necessary sleep therapy.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 4\n\nHere's a recommendation to improve your sleep, focusing on the likely contributing factors:\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Gradual Shift in Bedtime:** To address the later sleep timing, I recommend a gradual shift in your bedtime by 15 minutes every night for the next week. For example, aim to go to bed at 11:00 PM instead of 12:00 AM. This will help your body adjust to a more consistent sleep schedule.\n\n2.  **Consistent Sleep Environment:** Ensure your sleep environment is conducive to sleep. This includes a dark, quiet, cool room with a comfortable mattress and a clear line of sight. Aim to maintain this environment consistently, even on weekends.\n\n3.  **Morning Light Exposure:** Exposing yourself to natural light in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythm. Try to get outside or open your curtains to let sunlight in as soon as you wake up.\n\n4.  **Caffeine and Alcohol Caffeine and alcohol intake are likely contributing to the awakenings. Cut back on these substances and see if this improves your sleep. If not, consider reducing the amount consumed closer to bedtime.\n\n5.  **Deep Sleep and REM Sleep:** While the deep sleep percentage is slightly below the expected range, the REM sleep percentage is within the normal range. This suggests that your sleep architecture is not severely disrupted.\n\n6.  **Exercise:** Regular exercise is beneficial for sleep quality. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day. This can help improve sleep efficiency and overall sleep quality.\n\n7.  **Sleep Efficiency:** Focus on improving sleep efficiency by aiming for 8-10 hours of sleep. If you're consistently getting 7 hours of sleep, you can reduce the caffeine and alcohol intake earlier in the day to improve sleep efficiency.\n\n8.  **Monitor Your Sleep:** Keep a sleep log to track your sleep patterns, including the time you go to bed, wake up, and any awakenings. This will help you identify any patterns or areas for improvement.\n\n9.  **Consistency:** Stick to your new sleep schedule for at least one week before assessing any changes. Consistency is key to establishing a healthy sleep routine.\n\n10. **Consult a Healthcare Professional:** If you continue to experience persistent sleep issues despite making changes to your sleep environment, exercise routine, and caffeine and alcohol intake, consult a healthcare professional for further guidance. They can assess your sleep further and provide personalized recommendations.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 5\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n**1.** **Gradual Sleep Schedule Adjustment:** To improve sleep efficiency, consider a gradual shift towards a more consistent sleep schedule. This could involve aiming for a bedtime closer to your current time (e.g., 12:00 AM) and a wake-up time earlier than your current (e.g., 5:00 AM). The goal is to reduce the time spent awake in bed.\n\n**2.** **Exercise Routine:** If currently exercising twice a week, consider increasing this frequency to 3-4 times per week. This can help improve sleep quality, especially if you're a smoker. Even a short walk before bed can be beneficial.\n\n**3.** **Smoking Cessation:** If smoking is a significant factor contributing to your sleep issues, quitting is crucial. The benefits of quitting far outweigh the temporary discomfort of smoking.\n\n**4.** **Light Exposure:** Exposing yourself to bright light, especially in the morning, can help regulate your circadian rhythm. This might involve taking a short walk outside or using a light therapy box after waking up.\n\n**5.** **Consistency:** Aim to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends, to improve sleep efficiency. This might require setting an earlier bedtime and wake-up time and sticking to it even on days off.\n\n**6.** **Caffeine and Alcohol:** Avoid caffeine and alcohol for at least 3-4 hours before bedtime, as they can disrupt sleep architecture and reduce sleep efficiency.\n\n**7.** **Homeostatic Sleep Drive:** If your sleep duration is consistently low, consider increasing your overall sleep duration to 7-8 hours. This can help improve sleep efficiency and reduce awakenings.\n\n**8.** **Monitor Progress:** Keep a sleep log to track your sleep patterns, including timing, efficiency, and awakenings. This will help you identify areas for improvement and make adjustments accordingly.<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 1\n\nGiven the trainee's normal BMI and low blood pressure, a gradual progression to avoid injury is crucial.<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 2\n\nGiven the trainee's overweight BMI, it's essential to recommend a fitness program that is tailored to their body composition and caloric needs. \n<|eot_id|>\nType: nan | ID: 3\n\nGiven the trainee's relatively low BMI and normal blood pressure, prioritizing injury prevention is essential.<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 4\n\nGiven the trainee's obesity, it is crucial to prioritize gradual progression, avoid overexertion, and focus on overall fitness and strength, rather than solely focusing on cardiovascular fitness.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 5\n\nGiven your low BMI, I recommend a gradual progression in exercise intensity and duration to avoid injury and maximize gains.\n<|eot_id|>\n\nLoading model: johnjehiel/PH-LLM-Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-bnb-4bit\n==((====))==  Unsloth 2025.2.15: Fast Llama patching.

Extrinsic Factors (Very Likely):**\n\n*   **Caffeine Consumption (75mg):** The most significant factor affecting your sleep is the high caffeine intake. Caffeine is a stimulant that can disrupt sleep architecture, even if it doesn't manifest as obvious awakenings. The caffeine intake can interfere with sleep onset, sleep architecture, and daytime anxiety.\n*   **Exercise Frequency (2):** While regular exercise is generally beneficial for sleep, the frequency of 2 times per week might be insufficient to promote optimal sleep quality.\n\n**2. Homeostatic Drive (Possible):**\n\n*   **Sleep Efficiency (84%):** Your sleep efficiency is good, but slightly disrupted by the two awakenings. This could suggest a reasonable homeostatic drive, but the high caffeine intake might be masking other sleep disruptions.\n\n**3. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Possible):**\n\n*   **Awakenings (2):** Two awakenings can be a sign of hyperarousal, which is a common sleep issue. This could be related to stress, anxiety, or other emotional factors.\n\n**4. Circadian Rhythm (Unlikely):**\n\n*   **Bedtime (10:00 PM) and Wake-up time (6:00 AM):** The 10:00 PM bedtime and 6:00 AM wake-up time suggest a relatively consistent sleep schedule. This suggests a stable circadian rhythm, which is good for maintaining a healthy sleep-wake cycle.\n\nTo better understand your sleep patterns, consider tracking your caffeine intake and exercise frequency for a week, as well as monitoring your sleep efficiency and number of awakenings. This will help you better understand how these factors are impacting your sleep. Reducing caffeine intake and increasing exercise frequency could significantly improve your sleep quality.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 2\n\nOkay, let's break down the potential causes for the sleep issues, prioritizing relevance and likelihood:\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Likelihood: 9/10)**\nThe most likely cause is the high caffeine intake (100mg). Caffeine is a stimulant that can disrupt sleep architecture, leading to fragmented sleep and reduced sleep efficiency. The caffeine consumption is likely affecting the sleep stages, especially deep sleep, which is significantly lower than expected.\n\n**2. Homeostatic Sleep Drive (Likelihood: 6/10)**\nThe sleep duration (8 hours) is within the recommended range, but the sleep efficiency is low. This suggests that the homeostatic sleep drive may be slightly reduced, but it's not the primary issue.\n\n**3. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Likelihood: 5/10)**\nThe high number of awakenings (3) and low sleep efficiency indicate some level of hyperarousal. However, the caffeine consumption is likely a more significant factor.\n\n**4. Circadian Rhythm (Likelihood: 4/10)**\nWhile an early bedtime is beneficial, the sleep fragmentation and low sleep efficiency suggest that the circadian rhythm may be slightly off. However, this is likely influenced by the extrinsic factors.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 3\n\nOkay, let's break down the potential causes behind your sleep patterns, focusing on the most relevant factors. Keep in mind that a comprehensive evaluation requires more data, especially on your sleep history.\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Likelihood: 9/10)**\nYour smoking habit is a significant factor, likely impacting sleep quality. Nicotine is a stimulant, and smoking can disrupt sleep architecture. The moderate alcohol consumption (5 units) may also be contributing to sleep fragmentation.\n\n**2. Homeostatic Drive (Likelihood: 8/10)**\nYour sleep duration of 8 hours is within the recommended range, suggesting a reasonable homeostatic drive. However, the sleep efficiency of 90% indicates that the sleep is not necessarily deep or restorative.\n\n**3. Circadian Rhythm (Likelihood: 7/10)**\nYour consistent bedtime and wake-up time support a stable circadian rhythm. The midsleep point is appropriate, indicating a well-regulated sleep-wake cycle.\n\n**4. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Likelihood: 5/10)**\nWhile one awakening is minimal, the lack of information on stress levels, anxiety, or other hyperarousal factors makes it difficult to assess the relevance of this factor. More data is needed to determine its impact.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 4\n\nOkay, let's break down the possible causes of your sleep patterns based on the data you provided, focusing on the most relevant factors.\n\n### 1. **Extrinsic Factors (Likelihood: 7/10)**\n\n*   **Caffeine Consumption (30mg):** Your moderate caffeine intake may be slightly impacting your sleep efficiency, especially if consumed too close to bedtime. The sleep efficiency of 88% suggests that caffeine is not the primary factor, but it's still worth monitoring.\n\n*   **Exercise Frequency (4 times a week):** Regular exercise is generally beneficial for sleep. It may be contributing to the stability of your sleep patterns.\n\n*   **Alcohol Consumption (0mg):** Since alcohol consumption is zero, it is unlikely to be a contributing factor.\n\n*   **Smoking Status (No):** Not smoking is a positive factor for sleep.\n\n### 2. **Homeostatic Drive (Likelihood: 5/10)**\n\n*   **Sleep Duration (8.5 hours):** Your sleep duration is within the optimal range for adults. However, the sleep efficiency could be improved with fewer awakenings.\n\n### 3. **Circadian Rhythm (Likelihood: 4/10)**\n\n*   **Bedtime (10:15 PM) and Wake-up time (6:45 AM):** A consistent bedtime and wake-up time suggest a well-aligned circadian rhythm. However, the sleep efficiency could be improved with fewer awakenings.\n\n### 4. **Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Likelihood: 3/10)**\n\n*   **Two Awakenings:** Two awakenings suggest some level of sleep fragmentation. While it is not a major issue, it could be a contributing factor.\n\n### What actions can you recommend to improve sleep? Tie recommendations to the very likely causes, for example, \"Recommendations to address Circadian rhythm\". Tie recommendations to user's sleep data such as average bedtime, average wake time, and number of naps, and recommend a goal bedtime and wake time based on their data. The recommendations should be time-bound, for example for the next week or the next month. Write one short question to ask the user in order to better understand their sleep. Avoid assumptions regarding trainings or medical conditions. Avoid generic statements. Avoid incorrect knowledge, inconsistencies and contradictions. Don't mention \"the user\". Talk like you're speaking directly to someone. Be concise.\n### Recommendations report\n\n\n### Question:\nOkay, let's better understand your sleep patterns. Can you describe your typical evening routine, starting from when you start to feel tired until you go to bed?<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 5\n\nOkay, let's break down the potential underlying causes for your sleep issues, considering the data you provided.\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Likelihood: 9/10)**\nYour high caffeine consumption (80mg) and smoking are likely major contributors to your sleep fragmentation. Caffeine is a stimulant that can interfere with sleep architecture, and nicotine can disrupt sleep continuity. These substances are well-known to interfere with sleep quality.\n\n**2. Homeostatic Sleep Drive (Likelihood: 6/10)**\nYour sleep efficiency of 80% is below optimal, suggesting that your body's drive to sleep is not being met. The 3.5 awakenings indicate a lack of sleep continuity, which may be related to the sleep pressure.\n\n**3. Circadian Rhythm (Likelihood: 4/10)**\nYour consistent bedtime and wake-up time are good, suggesting a stable circadian rhythm. However, the sleep fragmentation suggests a potential misalignment in the timing of sleep stages.\n\n**4. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Likelihood: 3/10)**\nThe 3.5 awakenings are concerning, but this is more likely a result of extrinsic factors rather than psychophysiologic hyperarousal. The high caffeine consumption and smoking are more likely contributing factors.\n\n**5. Other Factors (Likelihood: 2/10)**\nYour age (55) is not particularly relevant, and there's no mention of other lifestyle factors that could affect sleep.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 1\n\nOkay, let's focus on optimizing sleep quality and addressing the potential imbalances.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Light Sleep Optimization:** While light sleep is low, this may be a tracking artifact. However, to ensure optimal sleep architecture, consider gradually increasing light sleep by 10-15 minutes of napping around midday. This may help rebalance sleep stages.\n2.  **Deep Sleep Reduction:** Given the high percentage of deep sleep (70%), consider reducing this duration by 10-15 minutes of wakefulness immediately after waking up. This may help shift sleep architecture toward a more balanced distribution.\n3.  **REM Sleep Maintenance:** Since REM sleep is within the normal range (20%), focus on maintaining a consistent sleep schedule to ensure REM sleep duration remains stable.\n4.  **Awakening Reduction:** The single awakening is excellent, but consider monitoring your sleep patterns to identify any potential triggers that might be disrupting sleep continuity.\n5.  **Morning Sunlight Exposure:** Expose yourself to bright light in the morning (around 30 minutes after waking) to help regulate your circadian rhythm and improve sleep quality.\n\n**Recommendations for the next month:**\n\n*   **Bedtime:** 10:30 PM (consistent)\n*   **Wake time:** 6:30 AM (consistent)\n*   **Nap duration:** 15-30 minutes (around midday)\n*   **Wake time after napping:** 15-30 minutes\n*   **Morning light exposure:** 30 minutes after waking\n\n**Question to better understand sleep habits:**\n\n*   Can you describe your typical daily routine, including your morning and evening activities? This will help me understand how your lifestyle might be influencing your sleep.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 2\n\nOkay, let's break down what we know and what we can do to improve your sleep.\n\n**Key Takeaways Summary:**\n\n*   Your sleep duration (7.75 hours) and deep sleep (55%) are good, but your REM sleep (18%) is lower than typical, and you have 2 awakenings.\n*   Your sleep efficiency (90%) is within the acceptable range, but there is room for improvement.\n*   Your caffeine and alcohol consumption could be contributing to fragmented sleep.\n\n**Recommendations for Improving Sleep:**\n\n1.  **Refine Your Sleep Routine:** Try to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. This will help your body adjust to a more stable circadian rhythm.\n2.  **Reduce Caffeine and Alcohol Consumption:** Limit or avoid caffeine and alcohol before bedtime. Caffeine is a stimulant that can disrupt sleep, while alcohol can lead to fragmented sleep and awakenings.\n3.  **Increase Exercise Duration:** With 2 hours of exercise per week, you could aim to increase this to 3-4 hours per week. Regular exercise can help regulate your sleep-wake cycle and improve sleep quality.\n4.  **Improve Sleep Hygiene:** Maintain a dark, quiet sleep environment. Avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime, and try to relax before bed with a calming activity.\n5.  **Monitor Your Sleep:** Keep a sleep diary to track your sleep patterns, including bedtime, wake time, sleep duration, and number of awakenings. This will help you identify any patterns or issues that need attention.\n6.  **Gradual Bedtime Adjustment:** If your bedtime is consistently 11:15 PM, consider gradually adjusting it earlier by 15 minutes every few days until you reach a more consistent time.\n7.  **Morning Light Exposure:** Exposure to natural light in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythm. Spend time outside in the morning, or open your curtains to let sunlight in.\n8.  **Avoid Naps:** If you're having trouble sleeping, try to avoid napping during the day. If you do need a nap, keep it short (under 30 minutes) and avoid napping close to bedtime.\n\n**Key Factor Affecting Bedtime Consistency:** Your bedtime is consistently 11:15 PM, which may benefit from a more consistent schedule on workdays versus weekends. Try to maintain a consistent bedtime, even on weekends, to help your body adjust to a more stable circadian rhythm.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 3\n\nOkay, let's break down what we know and what we can do to improve your sleep balance.\n\n**Why Your Sleep Stages Are Out of Balance:**\n\nYour deep sleep percentage is significantly higher (65%) than what's typically seen (15-25%). This could be a sign of an imbalance in your sleep architecture. Your REM sleep percentage is within the normal range (22%), but the low light sleep percentage (13%) is unusual and may indicate atypical sleep stage cycling.\n\n**Recommendations to Balance Sleep Stages:**\n\n1.  **Maintain Consistent Sleep Timing:** Your bedtime (10:00 PM) and wake-up time (6:30 AM) are excellent. Aim to maintain this schedule.\n2.  **Improve Light Sleep Percentage:** Try to increase light sleep by reducing time spent in bed before sleep onset. This can help normalize sleep stage distribution.\n3.  **Reduce Deep Sleep Percentage:** To bring your deep sleep percentage closer to the normal range, focus on reducing the amount of time spent in bed before sleep onset. This can help your body transition into lighter stages more efficiently.\n4.  **Reduce Awakenings:** While you have only 1.5 awakenings, increasing sleep efficiency could help you feel more rested during the day. This might involve adjusting your sleep environment or practicing relaxation techniques before bed.\n\n**Recommendations for Your Routine:**\n\n1.  **Gradual Wind-Down:** Before bed, try to reduce your activity level and transition to a relaxing routine (e.g., reading, meditation, or a warm bath). This can help your body wind down and prepare for sleep.\n2.  **Limit Exposure to Screens Before Bed:** The blue light emitted from screens can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, a sleep hormone. Aim to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.\n3.  **Exercise Timing:** While you exercise regularly (3 times a week), consider adjusting the timing of your workouts to avoid vigorous exercise within 3 hours of bedtime. This can help reduce the amount of adrenaline in your system, making it easier to fall asleep.\n\n**Timing Considerations:**\n\nYour midsleep point (2:15 AM) is excellent for maintaining a natural circadian rhythm. This timing supports daytime alertness and overall well-being.\n\n**Sleep Efficiency:**\n\nYour sleep efficiency (92%) is excellent. However, to further improve sleep quality, focus on reducing awakenings and optimizing sleep stage distribution.<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 4\n\nOkay, let's work on shifting your bedtime earlier. Here's what I recommend:\n\n**Short-term goal (next week):**\n\n*   **Gradually adjust your bedtime by 30 minutes every other night**. This means if you're currently going to bed at 12:00 AM, aim for 11:30 PM for the next night, then 11:00 PM the following night, and so on.\n\n**Pre-bedtime habit modification (next week):**\n\n*   **Start winding down 1.5 hours before your desired bedtime**. This means if you're aiming for 11:00 PM, start relaxing at 9:30 PM. Engage in calming activities such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. Avoid screens (phones, tablets, or laptops) and electronic devices with bright lights, as the blue light they emit can interfere with your sleep.\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n*   **Limit caffeine intake to earlier in the day**. Avoid caffeine for at least 4-6 hours before your desired bedtime.\n*   **Reduce alcohol consumption**. Alcohol may initially help you fall asleep but can disrupt sleep later in the night. Aim to finish drinking at least 4-6 hours before bed.\n*   **Maintain a consistent wake-up time**, even on weekends, to help regulate your circadian rhythm.\n*   **Get morning sunlight exposure**. Exposing yourself to natural sunlight in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythm.\n*   **Avoid naps**. If you're having trouble sleeping, try to avoid napping during the day. If you do need a nap, keep it short (under 30 minutes) and avoid napping close to bedtime.\n*   **Exercise regularly**. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day. Exercise can help improve sleep quality, but avoid vigorous exercise within 3 hours of bedtime.\n*   **Monitor your sleep and track your progress**. Keep a sleep diary to monitor your sleep patterns, including the time you go to bed, wake up, and the number of naps you take. This will help you identify patterns and make adjustments accordingly.\n*   **Consider consulting a sleep medicine expert**. If you continue to struggle with sleep after implementing these changes, consider consulting a sleep medicine expert for personalized guidance.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you can work towards shifting your bedtime earlier and improving your overall sleep quality.<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 5\n\nOkay, let's break down the recommendations to improve your sleep.\n\n**1. Circadian Rhythm Adjustment (Next Month):** Focus on a more consistent sleep schedule. Aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This will help regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n**2. Sleep Environment Optimization (Next Month):** Create a sleep-conducive environment. This includes:\n- **Darkness:** Ensure your bedroom is completely dark. Consider blackout curtains or shades.\n- **Quiet:** Minimize noise. If your bedroom is noisy, consider using earplugs or a white noise machine.\n- **Cool Temperature:** Aim for a cooler temperature (around 60-67Â°F) to promote better sleep.\n- **Comfortable Bedding:** Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows.\n\n**3. Light Exposure (Next Month):** Gradually adjust your morning light exposure. When you wake up, expose yourself to bright light (e.g., a lamp or sunlight) for 15-30 minutes. This helps signal to your body that it's time to be awake.\n\n**4. Exercise and Caffeine Management (Ongoing):** Continue to maintain your exercise frequency of 2 times per week. Be mindful of caffeine intake, especially in the afternoon and evening. Avoid consuming caffeine for at least 4-6 hours before bedtime.\n\n**5. Sleep Hygiene (Ongoing):** Focus on maintaining good sleep hygiene practices, such as:\n- **Avoiding screens before bedtime**\n- **Avoiding heavy meals before bedtime**\n- **Avoiding naps during the day**\n\n**6. Smoking Reduction (Next Month):** Gradually reduce your smoking over the next month. Nicotine is a stimulant that can disrupt sleep. Reducing or quitting smoking will help improve sleep quality.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you can work towards improving your sleep quality, reducing awakenings, and increasing your overall sleep duration.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 1\n\nGiven the trainee's normal BMI, blood pressure, and heart rate, the primary focus should be on gradual progression of exercises to avoid overexertion and ensure proper recovery.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 2\n\nGiven your overweight BMI and elevated blood pressure, it's crucial to start slowly and gradually increase intensity to avoid putting excessive strain on your cardiovascular system.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: nan | ID: 3\n\nGiven the trainee's normal BMI, blood pressure, and heart rate, but slightly elevated blood pressure, a gradual progression of exercises with adequate warm-up and cool-down periods is crucial to prevent injury.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 4\n\nGiven the trainee's obesity, high blood pressure, and elevated stress levels, a gradual and progressive fitness program should be implemented to minimize the risk of injury, with close monitoring of their blood pressure and stress levels.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 5\n\nGiven the trainee's underweight status, it is crucial to ensure that the fitness program gradually increases intensity and volume to prevent exhaustion and injury.\n<|eot_id|>\n\nLoading model: johnjehiel/PH-LLM-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-bnb-4bit\n==((====))==  Unsloth 2025.2.15: Fast Llama patching.

This is excellent.\n\n**Duration:**  \nYour sleep duration of 6.2 hours is below the recommended 7-9 hours for adults. This is a concern and may be related to your smoking status.\n\n**Other:**  \nSmoking is negatively impacting your sleep. Nicotine is a stimulant that can disrupt sleep architecture, especially in older adults. The high deep sleep percentage may be an adaptation to the sleep fragmentation caused by smoking. Reducing or quitting smoking is highly recommended to improve sleep quality and overall health.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A1 | ID: 2\n\n# Sleep Insights Report\n\nHere's an analysis of your sleep data, focusing on key areas for improvement:\n\n**Routine**\n\n*   Your bedtime and wake time are consistent, which is great for establishing a stable sleep schedule.\n\n**Sleep Quality**\n\n*   Deep sleep percentage (55%) is significantly higher than the typical range (13-23%). While deep sleep is important, such a high percentage may indicate an imbalance in sleep architecture.\n*   Light sleep percentage (23%) is lower than the typical range (50-60%). This may contribute to difficulties falling asleep or staying asleep.\n*   REM sleep percentage (22%) is within the normal range (20-25%).\n\n**Alertness**\n\n*   You don't report napping, which is good for maintaining sleep continuity.\n\n**Timing**\n\n*   Your midsleep point is 2:30 AM. This is a relatively late sleep schedule, which may be impacting your circadian rhythm.\n\n**Efficiency**\n\n*   Your sleep efficiency (93%) is excellent, indicating you're spending a high proportion of time in bed actually asleep.\n\n**Duration**\n\n*   Your sleep duration (7 hours) is below the recommended 7-9 hours for adults. This could impact daytime alertness and overall health.\n\n**Other**\n\n*   Caffeine consumption (2 cups) may be affecting your sleep quality, especially if consumed in the afternoon or evening.\n*   Alcohol consumption (1 drink) can also disrupt sleep architecture, especially in the latter part of the night.\n*   Regular exercise (4 times a week) is beneficial for sleep and overall health.\n*   Smoking status (no) is positive.\n*   The high deep sleep percentage and low light sleep percentage suggest a potential imbalance in sleep architecture, which could be related to the caffeine and alcohol consumption.\n*   The late bedtime and low sleep duration may be related to the caffeine and alcohol consumption, which could be affecting the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A1 | ID: 3\n\n# Sleep Insights Report\n\nHere's an analysis of your sleep data, focusing on key areas for improvement:\n\n## Routine\n\n*   **Sleep Schedule Consistency:** Without more data, I can't assess the consistency of your sleep schedule. If your bedtime and wake time are consistent, it's good. However, if they vary significantly from day to day, it could impact sleep quality.\n\n## Sleep Quality\n\n*   **Deep Sleep:** Your deep sleep percentage (65%) is very high. This is likely outside the normal range and may indicate an imbalance in your sleep architecture. A typical range is 13-23%.\n*   **Light Sleep:** Your light sleep percentage (20%) is low. This is likely outside the normal range. A typical range is 50-60%.\n*   **REM Sleep:** Your REM sleep percentage (15%) is slightly below the average. A typical range is 20-25%.\n*   **Awakenings:** Two awakenings per night is a reasonable number. However, if you're experiencing difficulty falling back asleep after these awakenings, it could impact overall sleep quality.\n\n## Alertness\n\n*   **Nap Information:** There is no nap data available.\n\n## Timing\n\n*   **Bedtime and Wake Time:** Your bedtime (10:15 PM) and wake time (6:00 AM) are reasonable, but without more data on your chronotype (morning, evening, or intermediate), it's difficult to assess whether they align with your natural sleep preferences.\n\n## Efficiency\n\n*   **Sleep Efficiency:** Your sleep efficiency (85%) is good. This means you're spending a significant portion of your time in bed asleep.\n\n## Duration\n\n*   **Sleep Duration:** Your sleep duration (7.75 hours) is slightly below the recommended 7-9 hours for adults. This could be impacting your daytime alertness and overall well-being.\n\n## Other\n\n*   **Alcohol Consumption:** You consume 0.5 units of alcohol. While this is not a significant amount, alcohol can disrupt sleep architecture, especially in the later stages of sleep. It may be worth exploring whether reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption improves your sleep.\n*   **Exercise Frequency:** You exercise 2 times per week. Regular exercise is generally beneficial for sleep, but the frequency is a bit low. Increasing exercise frequency could improve sleep quality.\n*   **Caffeine Consumption:** You consume no caffeine. This is good, as caffeine can disrupt sleep, especially in the afternoon and evening.\n*   **Smoking Status:** You do not smoke. Smoking is a significant sleep disruptor, so this is positive.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A1 | ID: 4\n\nHere's an analysis of your sleep data, focusing on key areas:\n\n**Routine**\n\n*   **Bedtime at 12:30 AM and wake-up at 8:00 AM suggests a late sleep schedule.** This is a deviation from a typical sleep routine.\n\n**Sleep Quality**\n\n*   **Deep sleep at 50% is significantly above the average (13-23%) and is likely out of the normal range.** This is a concern as it may indicate an imbalance in sleep architecture.\n*   **Light sleep at 30% is below the average (50-60%).** This is a deviation from the normal range.\n*   **REM sleep at 20% is within the normal range (20-25%).** This is within the expected range.\n*   **One awakening is slightly above the average (0-1), but it's not a major concern.** This is a slight deviation from the preferred range.\n\n**Alertness**\n\n*   **No data on daytime alertness, nap frequency, or nap length.** This is a significant omission, as these metrics are important for understanding the impact of sleep on daily functioning.\n\n**Timing**\n\n*   **Midnight bedtime and 8:00 AM wake-up time indicate a late sleep schedule.** This is a deviation from a typical sleep schedule.\n\n**Efficiency**\n\n*   **Sleep efficiency at 90% is excellent and falls within the top 10th percentile.** This is a strong indicator of good sleep quality.\n\n**Duration**\n\n*   **7.5 hours of sleep is slightly below the recommended 7-9 hours for adults.** This is a slight deviation from the preferred range.\n*   **The late bedtime and wake-up time may contribute to the shorter sleep duration.** This is a potential factor.\n\n**Other**\n\n*   **Smoking is a significant risk factor for sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea and nicotine withdrawal.** This is a major concern that should be addressed.\n*   **Exercising 3.5 times a week is good, but consistency is key.** This is a positive factor.\n*   **Caffeine consumption at 1.0 is moderate, but it may still be affecting sleep.** This is a potential factor.\n*   **No alcohol consumption is positive.** This is a positive factor.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A1 | ID: 5\n\n# Sleep Insights Report\n\n## Routine\n\nBased on the provided data, a single night's sleep information is insufficient to assess routine consistency. Calculating standard deviations and average bedtime/wakeup times from multiple nights is necessary to evaluate this aspect.\n\n## Sleep Quality\n\n*   **Deep Sleep (60%):** This is significantly above the typical range (13-23%). This could be a sign of recovery from sleep deprivation or an underlying sleep disorder.\n*   **Light Sleep (15%):** This is below the typical range (50-60%). This could indicate an imbalance in sleep architecture.\n*   **REM Sleep (25%):** This is within the typical range (20-25%). REM sleep is important for cognitive function and emotional regulation.\n*   **Awakenings (0.5):** This is low. Typically, one or two awakenings per night are common, but if they are not significantly impacting sleep quality, it may not be a concern.\n\n## Alertness\n\nThere is no data on naps, so it's impossible to assess alertness.\n\n## Timing\n\n*   **Bedtime (11:00 PM):** This is a reasonable bedtime for someone of your age.\n*   **Wakeup Time (6:00 AM):** This is a reasonable wake time for someone of your age.\n*   **Midsleep Point (1:30 AM):** This is within a normal range for your age.\n\n## Efficiency\n\n*   **Sleep Efficiency (95%):** This is excellent. It indicates a high percentage of time spent asleep while in bed.\n\n## Duration\n\n*   **Sleep Duration (7 hours):** This is within the recommended range for adults (7-9 hours). However, individual sleep needs can vary.\n\n## Other\n\n*   **Caffeine Consumption (0.5):** This is a low amount of caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant and can interfere with sleep.\n*   **Alcohol Consumption (0):** This is good. Alcohol can disrupt sleep architecture.\n*   **Exercise Frequency (5 times/week):** This is excellent. Regular exercise is important for overall health and can improve sleep quality.\n*   **Smoking Status (No):** This is good. Smoking is associated with a range of sleep problems.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 1\n\nOkay, let's break down the potential causes of your sleep patterns, ordered from most to least relevant based on the data provided.\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Very Likely):** This is the most likely cause, given your high caffeine consumption (75.0). Caffeine is a stimulant that can significantly disrupt sleep architecture, even if you're getting a decent amount of sleep. The fact that you're experiencing two awakenings suggests that caffeine might be impacting your sleep quality. Reducing caffeine intake is likely to have a significant positive impact on your sleep.\n\n**2. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Possible):** While the data shows some positive sleep metrics, the two awakenings suggest that there might be some underlying hyperarousal. Hyperarousal can manifest as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and difficulty relaxing. The awakenings, combined with the high caffeine intake, suggest that this could be a contributing factor.\n\n**3. Homeostatic Drive (Possible):** With a sleep efficiency of 84% and only two awakenings, it's possible that your homeostatic sleep drive is adequate. However, the high caffeine intake might be impacting your ability to maintain sleep once you're asleep.\n\n**4. Circadian Rhythm (Unlikely):** The data suggests a consistent sleep schedule, with a 10:00 PM bedtime and 6:00 AM wake-up time. This suggests that your circadian rhythm is likely aligned with your sleep schedule.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 2\n\nOkay, let's break down the potential causes of your sleep issues, focusing on the most relevant factors.\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Very Likely):** The data strongly suggests that external factors are significantly impacting your sleep. The caffeine consumption of 100mg is a major concern. Caffeine is a known sleep disruptor, especially when consumed close to bedtime. It can lead to increased awakenings, reduced sleep efficiency, and fragmented sleep. Even though you don't consume alcohol, caffeine's impact on your sleep architecture is likely a significant contributor to your sleep issues.\n\n**2. Homeostatic Drive (Likely):** Your sleep duration is 8 hours, which is within the recommended range. However, your sleep efficiency is only 82%, and you experience three awakenings. This suggests that your homeostatic sleep drive, which is the build-up of sleep pressure throughout the day, might not be sufficient to maintain consistent sleep. The fragmented sleep and lower sleep efficiency may indicate a weaker homeostatic drive.\n\n**3. Circadian Rhythm (Possible):** Your bedtime at 9:45 PM and wake-up time at 5:45 AM suggest a relatively consistent sleep schedule. While this is beneficial, slight variations in sleep timing could affect your circadian rhythm. However, the data doesn't strongly indicate a significant circadian misalignment.\n\n**4. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Unlikely):** While awakenings can sometimes be related to hyperarousal, the data doesn't strongly suggest this as the primary cause. Your sleep efficiency is only 82%, which is lower than ideal, but it's not a clear indication of hyperarousal. \n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 3\n\nOkay, let's break down the potential causes of your sleep patterns based on the data you provided.\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Very Likely):** This is the most prominent factor, given the information you've shared. Your caffeine consumption (20mg) and alcohol intake (5 units) are likely influencing your sleep. Caffeine, even in moderate amounts, can disrupt sleep architecture and make it harder to fall asleep. Alcohol, while initially sedating, can lead to fragmented sleep later in the night as your body metabolizes it. Smoking is also a significant extrinsic factor, as nicotine is a stimulant that can interfere with sleep.\n\n**2. Homeostatic Drive (Possible):** With a sleep efficiency of 90% and only one awakening, it's possible that your homeostatic sleep drive is strong. This means you're likely able to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep, suggesting a good sleep drive.\n\n**3. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Unlikely):** With a good sleep efficiency and only one awakening, psychophysiologic hyperarousal is less likely. The data doesn't suggest significant difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, which are common symptoms of this condition.\n\n**4. Circadian Rhythm (Unlikely):** While a consistent bedtime is good, it's not possible to determine the circadian rhythm with only one night of data. More data is needed to determine the circadian rhythm.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 4\n\nOkay, let's break down the potential causes for your sleep patterns, based on the data you provided.\n\n**1. Homeostatic Drive (Likelihood: Very Likely)**: Your sleep duration is 8.5 hours, which is well within the recommended range. However, your sleep efficiency is 88%, which is slightly below the optimal range of 90-95%. This suggests that you may not be experiencing the strongest drive to sleep. The low sleep efficiency could be due to the two awakenings.\n\n**2. Extrinsic Factors (Likelihood: Likely)**: Your caffeine intake is 30mg. While this is not a high amount, it could still be affecting your sleep, especially if you're sensitive to its effects. It's worth noting that caffeine can disrupt sleep architecture, even at low doses.\n\n**3. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Likelihood: Possible)**: The two awakenings suggest that you may be experiencing some level of hyperarousal or difficulty relaxing before sleep. This could be due to stress, anxiety, or other factors that make it hard to wind down before bed.\n\n**4. Circadian Rhythm (Likelihood: Unlikely)**: Your bedtime at 10:15 PM and wake-up time at 6:45 AM indicate a stable circadian rhythm. This suggests that your body's natural sleep-wake cycle is likely aligned with your sleep schedule.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A2 | ID: 5\n\nOkay, let's break down the possible causes of your sleep issues, based on the data provided.\n\n**1. Extrinsic Factors (Very Likely):** The data strongly suggests that external factors are significantly impacting your sleep. The high caffeine consumption (80mg) and smoking status are particularly concerning. These stimulants can disrupt sleep architecture, making it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. The minimal exercise frequency (1 time per week) also plays a role.\n\n**2. Psychophysiologic Hyperarousal (Likely):** The 3.5 awakenings and lower sleep efficiency suggest that you may be experiencing hyperarousal. This is a state of heightened physiological and psychological tension that can make it difficult to relax and fall asleep. This might be related to the caffeine consumption and smoking.\n\n**3. Homeostatic Drive (Possible):** With 8 hours of sleep, the homeostatic drive should be sufficient, but the fragmented sleep and lower sleep efficiency suggest that the homeostatic drive may not be optimal. However, this is less likely compared to the other factors.\n\n**4. Circadian Rhythm (Unlikely):** The consistent bedtime and wake-up time (11:00 PM and 7:00 AM) suggest a well-established circadian rhythm. While it's always possible, it's less likely given the other factors.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 1\n\nOkay, here's a breakdown of recommendations based on your sleep data:\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Continue monitoring your sleep patterns for the next month:** Keep tracking your sleep data, including sleep duration, efficiency, and stage distribution. This will help determine if the unusual sleep stage proportions are consistent or if they are just a one-time anomaly.\n\n2.  **Maintain your current sleep schedule:** Your consistent bedtime (10:30 PM) and wake-up time (6:30 AM) are well-aligned with healthy sleep habits. If this schedule is stable, it supports your circadian rhythm and contributes to your good sleep efficiency.\n\n3.  **Focus on optimizing sleep environment:** Even with a good sleep schedule, the environment can still impact sleep quality. Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if necessary. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows.\n\n4.  **Exercise regularly, but not before bed:** You're currently exercising four times a week, which is excellent. Continue to prioritize regular physical activity. However, avoid exercising within three hours of your bedtime, as it can stimulate your body and make it harder to fall asleep.\n\n5.  **If you experience daytime fatigue, consider tracking your energy levels:** If you're feeling consistently tired during the day, despite your good sleep efficiency, it could indicate a sleep stage imbalance. Write down your energy levels at different times of the day for a week to see if there's a pattern.\n\n**Question to better understand your sleep habits:** What is your typical morning routine like? Do you have any consistent morning habits that could be influencing your sleep architecture?\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 2\n\nHere's a breakdown of recommendations to optimize your sleep:\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Aim for a bedtime between 10:30 PM and 11:30 PM and a wake-up time between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM, even on weekends. This will help regulate your circadian rhythm.\n\n2.  **Caffeine Reduction:** Limit caffeine intake to 50mg (about 1/2 of a typical 8oz cup of coffee) in the morning, and avoid it after 2 PM. This will reduce the likelihood of nighttime awakenings.\n\n3.  **Alcohol Reduction:** Limit alcohol consumption to 1 drink (about 12 oz of beer or 4 oz of wine) at least 2 hours before bedtime. Alcohol can disrupt sleep architecture and increase awakenings.\n\n4.  **Smoking Cessation:** Smoking is a major sleep disruptor. Quitting smoking can significantly improve sleep quality. Consider nicotine replacement therapy or counseling to aid in quitting.\n\n5.  **Exercise Timing:** Move your exercise routine to earlier in the day (morning or early afternoon). Avoid vigorous exercise within 3 hours of bedtime, as it can stimulate your body and make it harder to fall asleep.\n\n6.  **Sleep Environment:** Optimize your sleep environment by ensuring your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if necessary. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows.\n\n7.  **Wake-Up Time:** Set a consistent wake-up time, even on weekends. This will help regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n8.  **Sleep Tracking:** Continue tracking your sleep using a sleep tracker or mobile app. This will help you monitor your progress and identify any patterns or issues.\n\n**Key Factor to Adjust:** Your caffeine and alcohol consumption are likely affecting your sleep quality. By reducing these substances, especially in the afternoon and evening, you can improve your sleep continuity and increase your REM sleep percentage.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 3\n\nOkay, let's break down some recommendations to help balance your sleep stages, based on your sleep data.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Monitor Sleep Stage Distribution:** For the next month, track your sleep stages more closely, including REM, deep, light, and awakening times. This will help identify any patterns of imbalance.\n2.  **Optimize Pre-Sleep Routine:** Aim to establish a consistent pre-sleep routine, focusing on relaxing activities (e.g., reading, meditation, or a warm bath) 1-2 hours before bed. This can help regulate your sleep architecture.\n3.  **Gradual Sleep Restriction:** If you feel tired during the day, consider a gradual sleep restriction by shifting your bedtime 15-30 minutes later each night. This can help increase light sleep and potentially improve sleep stage distribution.\n4.  **Maintain Exercise Frequency:** Continue your regular exercise routine, as it supports overall sleep health.\n5.  **Avoid Stimulants Before Bed:** Since you don't consume caffeine or alcohol, maintain this habit to avoid disrupting sleep stages.\n6.  **Consider Sleep Environment:** If possible, ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool, which can help improve sleep quality.\n\n**Potential Fine-Tuning of Pre-Sleep Routine:**\n\n*   **One area to consider fine-tuning is your pre-sleep screen time.** While it's good that you don't consume caffeine or alcohol, the screen time before bed might be affecting your sleep stages. Aim to avoid screens for at least an hour before bed, or use blue light filtering glasses or apps.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 4\n\nHere's a plan to help you adjust your sleep schedule and improve sleep quality:\n\n**Short-term goals (Next week):**\n\n1.  **Gradual Bedtime Shift:** Move your bedtime 15-30 minutes earlier each night, starting from your current bedtime of 12:00 AM. Aim to reach a bedtime of 10:30 PM by the end of the week.\n2.  **Consistent Wake Time:** Set your wake-up time to 7:30 AM and stick to it, even on weekends.\n3.  **Pre-Bedtime Routine:** Establish a relaxing pre-sleep routine starting 1-2 hours before your desired bedtime. This can include activities like:\n    *   Reading a book\n    *   Taking a warm bath\n    *   Listening to calming music\n    *   Practicing gentle stretches\n    *   Avoiding screens (phones, tablets, computers)\n4.  **Caffeine and Alcohol Reduction:** Limit caffeine intake to only morning hours (before 10:00 AM) and avoid alcohol at least 3-4 hours before bedtime.\n\n**Long-term goals (Ongoing):**\n\n1.  **Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Continue to wake up at 7:30 AM and go to bed at 10:30 PM (or earlier) even on weekends, to reinforce your circadian rhythm.\n2.  **Monitor Sleep Quality:** Keep track of your sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, and sleep duration. Aim for a sleep efficiency of 90% or higher and fewer than 2 awakenings.\n3.  **Exercise Timing:** Try to finish your workout at least 3-4 hours before bedtime to allow your body time to wind down.\n4.  **Caffeine and Alcohol Limitations:** Avoid caffeine after 10:00 AM and limit alcohol consumption to special occasions or reduce it significantly.\n5.  **Sleep Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool (around 65Â°F/18Â°C). Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n6.  **Psychological Factors:** Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation, to reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nBy following this plan, you can improve your sleep quality, reduce awakenings, and adjust your sleep schedule to a healthier, more consistent pattern.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A3 | ID: 5\n\nOkay, let's work on improving your sleep.\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n2.  **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:** Make your bedroom a sleep sanctuary. This means dark, quiet, and cool. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if needed.\n3.  **Gradually Reduce Smoking:** Smoking is a known sleep disruptor. If you're a smoker, try to reduce your smoking rate over the next month. This may help improve sleep quality.\n4.  **Increase Exercise:** While you exercise regularly, increasing the frequency or duration of your workouts may help improve sleep quality. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day.\n5.  **Address Awakenings:** To reduce awakenings, try the 4-7-8 breathing technique before bed. This involves breathing in through your nose for 4 seconds, holding your breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat this cycle until you feel relaxed.\n6.  **Consider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):** If you're experiencing persistent sleep difficulties, consider consulting a healthcare professional about CBT-I. This is a non-pharmacological approach that addresses underlying thought patterns and behaviors contributing to sleep issues.\n\n**Modifying Your Routine:**\n\nOver the next month, focus on the following adjustments:\n\n*   **Bedtime:** Aim to go to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night to gradually shift your sleep schedule earlier.\n*   **Wakeup Time:** Try to wake up 15-30 minutes later each morning to gradually shift your wake time later.\n*   **Morning Light Exposure:** Expose yourself to bright light (preferably sunlight) within 30 minutes of waking up. This helps regulate your circadian rhythm.\n*   **Evening Screen Time:** Avoid screens (phones, tablets, computers) for at least an hour before bed. The blue light emitted can disrupt your sleep.\n*   **Wind-Down Routine:** Develop a relaxing pre-sleep routine, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music. Avoid stimulating activities.\n\n**Monitoring Progress:**\n\n*   **Sleep Duration:** Track your average sleep duration over the next month. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n*   **Sleep Efficiency:** Monitor your sleep efficiency. Aim for a sleep efficiency of 85% or higher.\n*   **Awakenings:** Track the number of awakenings per night. Aim for fewer than 2 awakenings per night.\n*   **Mood:** Pay attention to your mood and energy levels throughout the day. If you notice significant improvements, it may indicate better sleep quality.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations and tracking your progress, you can work towards improving your sleep duration and reducing awakenings.<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 1\n\nGiven the trainee's excellent sleep, moderate activity level, and normal BMI, the primary focus should be on a gradual progression of intensity and volume to avoid overtraining and prevent injury.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 2\n\nGiven the trainee's overweight BMI and slightly elevated blood pressure, a gradual and progressive approach to exercise is crucial to avoid injury.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: nan | ID: 3\n\nGiven the trainee's normal demographics and low stress level, a well-structured fitness program with proper progression and recovery is sufficient to minimize injury risk.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 4\n\nGiven the trainee's obese BMI and high blood pressure, a gradual and progressive approach is crucial to avoid overexertion and potential cardiovascular complications.\n<|eot_id|>\nType: A6 | ID: 5\n\nGiven the trainee's underweight BMI and low daily steps, a gradual and well-structured program is crucial to prevent overexertion and promote healthy weight gain.\n<|eot_id|>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-26T16:14:31.771978Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-26T16:14:31.772281Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-26T16:14:31.786509Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-26T16:14:31.772244Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-26T16:14:31.785702Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   Category  ID                                             Prompt  \\\n0        A1   1  You are a sleep medicine expert.
