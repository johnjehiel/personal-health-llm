Optionally add a heading called Other for any additional factors. For Routine, evaluate the consistency of bedtime, wake time, and midsleep point. For Sleep Quality, analyze the durations of light, deep, and REM sleep as well as any wake time after sleep onset. For Alertness, assess nap frequency and duration. For Timing, examine bedtime and wake time patterns (including weekend vs. workday differences). For Efficiency, compare sleep efficiency and related measures to similar users. For Duration, review overall sleep duration with corresponding percentiles.
